<h1>Exploratory Testing Academy</h1>

To celebrate 25 years in exploratory testing in 2020, I'm launching an effort to teach modern exploratory testing.
<p>
Exploratory Testing Academy will showcase:
<ul>
  <li>99 minute online workshops - each with a specific constraint creating session focus for learning</li>
  <li>Video and audio content on concepts and techniques</li>
  <li>optional payment on value received within the financial constraints of the student</li>
</ul>

There is no organization sponsoring the effort, it is between me and the community. <p>

The first 99 minute workshops are:
<ul>
  <li>Aug 20th: Exploratory Testing While Documenting with Test Automation
    <a href="https://ti.to/exploratory-testing-academy/document-as-TA">[Tickets]</a>
  <br>
  How does exploratory testing change when while exploring, we significantly focus on
  creating systematic executable documentation? Whether you know your way around code or not,
  this session gives you an experience to build on in real life projects. We are using Robot
  Framework to explore a data-intensive domain we don't know beforehand. </li>
  <li>??: How Would You Test a Text Field?
  <br>
  This session explores a classic job interview question and shows dimensions to a seemingly
  simple question with a simple test application. What ideas do you use before you call your testing done?</li>
  <li>??: Systematic feature test ideation
  <br>
  You're given a new feature to test, how do you figure out what tasks that includes in a way that you can
  explain with your team and get their contribution too? </li>
  <li>??: Change testing
  <br>
  Looking at a series of actual code changes, this session rehearses targeting testing inspired by
  commit messages and contents. We learn to read code without reading code, and turning that into ideas of
  what we might test after the change. </li>
  <li>??: Exploring an API Java Edition</li>
  <li>??: Exploring an API Python Edition</li>
</ul>
