        <h1>Python for Testing</h1>

        <p>
            Recently, I have found myself walking through newbies to all things programming 
            to contributing to programmatic tests. Some people keep these tests hidden on 
            their own computers, as throwaway code that does already some work for them 
            while they learn. Others start with small changes into automatically running 
            tests of their teams, growing in comfort with reading and tiny changes. 
        </p>

        <p> This collects some of the things I find myself teaching.</p>

        <h2>Anatomy of a Test</h2>

        <code>
                def test_something():
                    assert True
        </code>
